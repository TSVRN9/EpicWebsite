# RhythmThing
This is a complete work in progress and is an exercise in programming and the sort. The result of this project will hopefully be a little rhythm trainer thing.

- [] learn how to use html & create base website
- [] make it do things using js (somehow)
- [] make it look *aesthetic* (using css)
- [] polish polish polish!! (not the country)
